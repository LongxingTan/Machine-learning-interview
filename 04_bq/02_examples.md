## The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it?
> earn trust, customer obsession

The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I took on and led a project for the first time. I got a requirement from the client about updating parts of a certain workflow. So I documented the requirements, worked on them with the team, and released the update to the demo system on time, however, the client tried and didn’t like it.
We diagnosed the feedback and system immediately, It turned out that we paid a lot of attention on the changes the client requested us to do, but didn’t do much evaluation on other features that are impacted by the change.
I apologized to the client immediately and asked if we could have an extended delivery date. Luckily the client agreed and also showed understanding. Then I called a meeting with all the team members, talked about the feedback, then we walked through the whole workflow step by step together, evaluated all the possible operations that user might take on each step and then tailored the change we were gonna make accordingly. Throughout this process, the team members understood what happened, why the client was not happy, and they also brought up a lot of good opinions. Instead of just telling the team to make changes again, I earned their trust by sharing the feedback with them and working out a solution together.
We then released a tentative version to the demo system before the deadline, walked through it with the client and collected feedback provided. Finally, we delivered the update to the production successfully, our client was very happy and used it every day without any trouble yet.


## Most challenging project
> Deliver Results

I always strive to use the challenging project as a learning opportunity to enhance my skills and performance.
The most challenging project I’ve done was an online collaborative coding platform, it’s like Leetcode but with collaborative feature. The most challenging part was to incorporate collaborative features with the code editor, that is, user in a same coding room can see the real-time cursor movements and typing actions of the other users.
It was challenging because I was supposed to come up with the solution and implement it by myself, and I have never developed something like this before.
So I started with composing a visual solution first, the work I’ve done included researching online collaborative products, listing core features I needed, building wireframes, and designing UI. With the visual solution, I had a good understanding on how the application would work. Then, I googled and read a lot of system design solutions for products with similar features, like Google doc, online chatting room, etc. With what I’ve read, I was able to draft out my own solutions and selected corresponding technologies.
I implemented it successfully within the given time, and my solution received a positive feedback because it is not only working well, but also visually pleasing. Throughout this process, I learned that it is important to be curious and keep learning, try to read as many technical blogs or articles as you can, the more you read, the better you’ll ace a problem or design. The feeling of ownership is very important, some other students just gave up with the excuse “I don’t how to do it"


## Tell me about the most difficult interaction you had at work.
> Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
disagree with boss?

If I have different idea with my manager or boss, I will try to collect data or make a prototype trying to convince him. If I have tried my best and he still disagree, then I would respect his decision and start committing for that.
when we released the service for US Logistics. The client complaint that some invoices were missed. I checked around and found that Telamon Network blocked some of the emails sent by the client. I talked the problem to the network administrator and they couldn’t change the email restrictions due to the policy.
Therefore, I brought this problem up to my manager and suggested to register another business mailbox provided by gmail or microsoft. The manager disagreed at first because he thought it was unprofessional if we didn’t use our own corporate email domain. I thought solving this problem was more important because our client would lose the trust on the quality of our data. In order to convince him, I showed him the data of email missing rate and the impacts on our client, and also I registered a good domain name composed by our company and department name, so we could still be professional on that part.
Finally, the manager was convinced and agreed on my suggestion. We barely have any missed emails after we switched our mailbox. And because of the good result, we started to use the domain for other projects gradually.


## Walk us through a time when you helped a customer through a difficult process and what that looked like.
> CUSTOMER OBSESSION

leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
- case 1
Last year in T, I took on and led a project of developing a web application for our Telecom engineering team, in order to help engineers build and manage detail specifications easily for their Telecom installation jobs. The detail specification building process was sort of complex, involving a lot of data entry and field data collection, and the requirement documentation provided to us was brief and totally in text description.
Therefore, it is challenging for me to come up with an intuitive and engineer-friendly design.
In order to understand the process thoroughly, I made several appointments with the engineering team, going through the specification building process with them step by step in detail. Then, I did some field observations, looking at how engineers use their iPads and computers in the field and in the office, when and how they input the data to complete a detail specification. Based on what I’ve learned and observed, I was able to come up with data schemas, draft a working prototype, and bring it to the engineers to collect feedback.
It turned out that the prototype was very helpful, it saved us around 10% time when implementing the web application. After the production was released, the engineers tried and loved it immediately. They said they took less time building a specification now with less error. The customer was obsessed with our professional process and result, and start to have more business with us.
- case 2(customer obsession and ownership, highest standard)
In Telamon, once I led the team to implement an AP processing service for one of our client - Hubert Corporation. We provide a customized AP processing system as well as a team of AP clerks to help Hubert process their invoices. Since invoices from different vendors might require different ways of processing and our client didn’t have a full instruction for that (they usually process invoices based on their knowledge and familiarity), we had to spend time emailing back and forth discussing about instructions whenever there was a special invoice processed incorrectly.
I looked at the invoices reported and thought we could do better in managing different invoices, vendors and corresponding instructions, and thus reducing the communication effort put by the client and us.
I first created a shared matrix and recorded all the invoices and instructions provided, and asked our AP clerks to update it as long as there was any new invoice feedback from the client. Then based on the analysis of the matrix, I created a checklist listing certain type of error-prone invoices and asked our AP quality managers to check on these type of invoices every day. Further, I programed and applied notifications for several type of invoices with special instructions in the system, so that our AP clerks didn’t have to watch out for them all the time.
After several weeks of running the service, I scheduled a meeting with the client and reviewed the matrix with them, they were impressed by it. And they even used the matrix as the instructions on their side. After a month or two, we barely got any email about incorrectly processed invoices from the client. We obsessed our client with our great quality and attitude to insist on the highest standards.


## Give me a example of when you took a risk and it failed.
> OWNERSHIP

leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “That’s not my job”.
- case 1
I’d like to talk about one of my project at BitTiger. BitTiger had a bootcamp course for project managers and I was hired as the lead developer to help implement the idea driven by the project managers teamed with me.
Our task was to improve BitTiger's current communication channels between teachers and students, and integrate them more with its official web portal.
Since I was the person who was going to lead another developer to build the product, it was important for me to understand the user needs and the decisions made by the project manager thoroughly. The best way to do so was to actively take part in the decision making process from the very beginning. Therefore, for most of the activities hosted by the project managers, I asked to join them, like, taking notes while the project managers were interviewing with teachers and students, coming up with suggestions while they were discussing about user personas and stories, offering help while they were building wireframes, and joining discussion when they were creating and prioritizing tasks.
I was able to implement the product quickly because I totally understood what the project managers wanted. We didn't need to spend time communicating the requirements again. With the time saved, I was able to add more customized features making the product easier to use. On the demo day, we had a great presentation and received very good reviews.
- case 2
the communication feature is not easy to use, only remind the client you received a new message and log in. The client didn't log in to the system very often. Sometimes the client just email back to me saying what happened.
I took the ownership to support this project, I designed a new process by delivering the content to the kitchen designer and bring it to the client to discuss. the client agreed. After deliver, our customer support team has reduced around 70% support request for this project.


## Tell me a time when you created an innovative product.
> INVENT AND SIMPLIFY

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
- case 1
question board, BitTiger need to manager a lot of things, like notification, link to the live course, questions, communication. We are overwhelmed at the first about inventing the process, thinking about a lot of ideas like group by different tabs, create with different categories. But I decided to keep it simple and stupid, we create the post for all purpose, but group it by weeks. All important notification on the top.
care more about look and feel rather than a lot of features
- case 2
The project we did for hartson kennedy was to help process their drawing and purchase order. The customers usually order countertops in their stores and kitchen designers then doing the drawings and generate PO paperwork, and send to us. However, the kitchen designer only uses fax machine, but we didn't have fax machine.
Instead of just purchasing a fax machine and assigning a person to handle the scanning everyday, I googled and did a research online first. I found a service that can receive the fax via email. I created a distribution list and registered it as the receiving mailbox.
With the simplified process, we don’t have spent money and time dealing with fax machine and scanning.I invented and simplified the fax receiving process and saved money for our company.
ARE RIGHT, A LOT: Tell me about a time when you observed two business opportunities to improve ROI, and how did you determine that they were connected.
Leaders are right a lot, they have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspective and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
tell me about a time when you are wrong


## Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a poor performer on your team.
> HIRE AND DEVELOP THE BEST

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their in coaching others. We work on behalf of out people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
- case 1: for the data entry team in China, they didn’t care much about the system before. When I led the project, I will invite them to join the meeting, tell them I develop the system, teach them how to test and ask them to feel free to give me feedback if they any idea. they are the direct users of the system.
finally these employees are very helpful for testing new features, and improve the efficiency of the indexing.
- case 2: When I transfer the projects from one person to another, I will co-work with them for a while, making sure the things they completely get the idea.


## How do you find the time to stay inspired, acquire new knowledge, innovate in your work?
> LEARN AND BE CURIOUS: 

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act on explore them.
- case 1: I recently learned how Redux architecture and how it works. actions, global status, dispatch actions
- case 2: how large company deploy their front-end, how to cache


## Tell me about a time when you could have stopped working but persisted.
> INSIST ON THE HIGHEST STANDARDS: 

Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
- case 1
hubert three way matching features, we have implemented the feature successfully. But I found the processor took long time to compare the amount of receipt, Purchase order, and invoice, calculate the tolerant percentage, identify any mismatches. I took the initiative to add exception handling features, instead of finding mismatches by eyes, I add a box to input and compare the amounts by the program.
it turned out the efficiency has improved a lot.
- case 2
client give us the ftp, and overwrite data every day, sometimes if there is holiday, we may miss one or two load. I write a program to fetch the file and archive the data by date, so that we’ll always have the backup if there is any issue happened.
http://www.codejava.net/java-se/networking/ftp/java-ftp-file-download-tutorial-and-example


## Tell me about a time when you proposed a new business.
> THINK BIG

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
- case 1: augmented reality to find store
- case 2: ambient building


## Describe how you would handle a busy situation where three people are waiting for help from you.
> BIAS FOR ACTION

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

the other engineer and I discussed for a couple of hours, figured out what we disagreed on, and I suggested that neither answer was necessarily better. She agreed. I said that unless she had any new info, I’d rather we just pick mine, and we could always come back to the decision later if we learned something new.
example??


## Tell me about a time when you thought of a clever new way to save money for the company.
> FRUGALITY

- case 1： for most of internal tools, we’ll google first instead of developing by ourselves.
- case 2： USL, this project is a little hurry, we don’t have enough resources for that. Average of processing one load takes around 4.5min, and we watch all the steps, automatically whatever we can, and reduce the process time to 2 min finally.


## Tell me a time when you earned trust of a group.
> EARN TRUST

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body order smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
vocally self-critical
The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I took on and led a project for the first time by myself. I got a requirement from the client about updating parts of a certain workflow. I listed the requirements, developed with the team, and released the update to the demo system on time, however, the client tried and didn’t like‍‍‌‍‍‍‌‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‌‌‌‌‌‌ it.
I diagnosed the system immediately, It turned out that we paid a lot of attention on the changes the client requested us to do, but didn’t do much evaluation on other features that are impacted by the change. A solid evaluation and design was necessary in this case because all the features in the workflow were closely connected to each other, and even a small change might cause butterfly effect.
I apologized to the client immediately and asked if we could have an extended delivery date. Luckily the client agreed and also showed understanding. Then I called a meeting with the dev team, walked through the whole workflow step by step together, evaluated all the possible operations that user might take on each step and then tailored the change we were gonna make accordingly. We then released a tentative version to the demo system before the deadline , walked through it with the client, and collected any feedback provided.
Finally, we delivered the update to the production successfully, our client was very happy and used it every day without any trouble yet.
DIVE DEEP: Tell me about a time when you had to dive deep into the data and the results you achieved.
trust but verify
you believe the person but check the facts anyway
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task beneath them.


## Tell me about a time when you overcame an obstacle and delivered results.
> DELIVER RESULTS

leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
what you’d do after you realized you couldn’t hit the date?
First, I’d check every possible way that could possibly make me hit the date, like using after-work time, weekends, or holidays, asking for help or suggestions, finding alternatives or simpler solutions, etc. Since I am the owner of the tasks, it’s my responsibility to deliver results on time. It’s my fault that I underestimated the workload when I took the tasks.
There was one time that we couldn’t finish the troubleshooting of a bug on time, the system should have sent out auto emails at 7:00 am but sometimes it failed. Before solving the problem, I will check each morning and manually trigger emails to the client.
If I still couldn’t hit the date, I would look at features, pick out a few with highest priority that I could finish, and then discuss about the problem with the project manager. Of course, I would apologize first and then try to discuss about the best solution to minimize the impacts. Once the project manager agrees, I would notify all the people that could be impacted by the delay.DELIVER RESULTS: Tell me about a time where you overcame an obstacle and delivered results.

## tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information
> Bias for Action

make a decision, but also consider the opinions of the other people
- case 1
we have a indexing team in China that helps enter the data on the invoice, I designed the indexing panel for them. Before making the decision, I decided to talk to the staff who are doing the data entry. Ask them to try and record the time and provide feedback. It turned out that they have some very good point of view, like amount match, required text-box color. And I changed my design and improve 10% processing time.
- case 2
once I argue with the manager about issue the corporate email, I want to register emails from MS and Gmail for business use because Telamon email sometimes blocks, and we have to contact Telamon IT which are not very responsible. The manager disagree at first, he said the corporate email is more professional. I collected the issue happened, and the impact on the client, feedback from them, average time IT reach and solve the problem, it turned out that we cannot bare it. then the manager agrees to switch as long as we can get a good domain name. We then applied a domain based on coporate and the name of our department. Everyone is happy.

- 如何处理模糊不清的目标? 与项目发起人和关键利益相关者进行深入的讨论, 而且经过很多迭代之后，我们也发现，会有一些直觉。有些设计听上去比较别扭，那么很可能就是有问题的，这种时候就要进一步讨论.


## What are your weaknesses?
> Learn and Be Curious

我的一个弱点是，在处理多任务时有时会感到压力，尤其是在时间紧迫的情况下。这可能会导致我在短时间内难以集中注意力，从而影响我的工作效率。为了应对这个问题，我已经开始使用时间管理工具，如Trello和Asana，来帮助我更好地组织和优先处理任务。我还参加了时间管理培训课程，学习如何更有效地分配时间和资源。通过这些改进措施，我发现自己能够更好地处理多任务，并且在时间紧迫的情况下也能保持高效。我的团队也注意到我在处理复杂项目时的进步，这让我更有信心在未来面对类似的挑战。总的来说，我认识到在处理多任务时感到压力是我需要改进的地方。通过采取积极的措施，我不仅提高了我的工作效率，还增强了我的时间管理能力。我相信，这种持续改进的态度将帮助我在未来的职业生涯中不断成长和进步。


## What are the areas where you need to improve your skills?
> Learn and Be Curious


## What do you like least about your previous job/internship?
> Earn Trust, Customer Obsession

“我在之前的工作中，发现团队沟通有时不够顺畅，尤其是在跨部门合作时。信息传递不及时或不准确，导致项目进度受到影响，甚至有时需要重新调整计划。为了应对这个问题，我主动发起并组织了定期的团队会议，确保每个成员都能及时了解项目进展和遇到的问题。我还引入了项目管理工具，如Jira和Slack，以提高信息传递的效率和准确性。此外，我鼓励团队成员之间进行更多的面对面交流，以增强彼此的理解和信任。通过这些改进措施，我们团队的沟通效率显著提高，项目进度也更加顺利。团队成员之间的合作更加紧密，项目交付的质量和速度都有了明显的提升。总的来说，我发现团队沟通不畅是我之前工作中最不喜欢的部分。然而，通过采取积极的措施，我不仅改善了团队的沟通效率，还增强了团队的协作能力。我相信，这种持续改进的态度将帮助我在未来的职业生涯中更好地应对类似的挑战。

## Tell me a time you have to work under the tight deadline
> Deliver Results

**Situation:**
I have faced quite a few instances in my career where I have had to work to tight deadlines. However, one occasion that particularly stands out was during my tenure as a Lead Software Developer at my previous organization. We were working on a major product launch but midway through the project, our senior management made the difficult decision to move the deadline up by several weeks, due to change of the market condition. This left us with significant amount of work to complete in a much shorter time frame.

**Task:**
So the challenge was how to finish the work within the deadline.

**Action:**
To tackle the challenge, I did a few things.
Firstly, I sat down with the team and re-evaluated our project timeline. It was essential for everyone to understand the situation we were in and the new expectations. I then strategically prioritised the tasks based on their impact on the project, identifying which tasks could be done concurrently and which tasks were dependent on others.
Secondly, I identified two developers from other teams that could help the project based on their experience and skill set. Then I asked the management to allow them pause what they worked and helped on the project for a while and the request was approved.
Thirdly, I discussed with the team and suggested to put in some extra hours each week. I explained to the team that no one liked working overtime, but this was really needed in such a critical time when meeting the deadline is extremely important. So all the team members agreed to put extra hours every week. I understood that people might have difficulties to work overtime at times so I maintained an open line of communication for any team member to express concerns or issues.
After this, I implemented a more rigorous daily check-in to keep track of the project’s progress. This not only helped in identifying any potential roadblocks early but also ensured that everyone was aligned on the project status and the tasks they were responsible for.
Simultaneously, I kept the management informed of our progress. Transparency was crucial, so we made sure to provide regular updates, reassuring them that we were doing our utmost to meet the revised deadline.

**Result:**
Eventually, I was able to lead the project to completion on time without compromising on the quality of our work. It was a very challenging period, but it underscored the importance of strategic planning, effective communication, and teamwork when working under tight deadlines.
