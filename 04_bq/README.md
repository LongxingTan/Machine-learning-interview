## 1. BQ常见问题

**一定提前准备若干的工作小故事(约3分钟，450words)，并且背后对应着leadership principles，见[BQ回答实例](./02_examples.md)

- give some examples that you help others
- conflicts with manager，跟老板/同事/组内/组外如何处理冲突
  - In most cases, I handle conflict well. I value diversity and understand that different people have different opinions, which may lead to conflict. When faced with conflict, I work to collaborate with others to resolve the issue in a way that is mutually beneficial for everyone involved. Sometimes, I can become defensive when trying to express my opinion. I am practicing tactics to manage this behavior, such as pausing to take a deep breath and carefully considering my words before responding.
- challenging project
- think differently
- simple solution to solve a problem

- 怎么带团队，怎么指导junior
  - communicate work expectations clearly to team members
  - throughout a task or project, I monitor key performance indicators to see if the team is on schedule, within budget and producing quality work
  - In my previous role as a team lead, I managed a team of five junior developers. I provided regular feedback on their work, set and reviewed their individual goals, and organized training sessions to improve their skills. As a result, each member of my team was able to take on more responsibility and contribute to the overall success of the project.
  - leader should act like a supportive coach. I give my team members space to unleash their talent while providing constructive feedback, regular performance reviews and training sessions. I aim to run an open, transparent and honest operation.
  - My opinion is that the metrics a team focuses on should strongly link to a company’s strategic objectives. In a general sense, I always look at quantity, quality and time. For instance, to measure the quality of work, it’s important to look at the number of errors and customer satisfaction. Another thing I measure is employee morale and engagement because those can make or break a team
