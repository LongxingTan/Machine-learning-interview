# 行为面试 Behavior question

> 有针对的准备BQ是**非常**有必要的。BQ主要考察沟通理解能力、文化匹配、资深程度。系统设计和BQ往往决定了offer上限
>
> - 故事的重点是体现自己的认知，不光是做了什么，而是为什么这样做 (系统、全局、策略、high level thinking)，从而给出足够的信号。selling your stories and zooming at the right things
> - 体现impact/scope、data driven、足够细节，使用`I`而不是`We`
> - 目标级别高的话，重点强调自己cross-team/cross functional的leadership
> - context之前先用一句话对故事进行总结，action分3-5点讲，同样每点先用一句话总结，总分结构
> - 回答简洁，直击signal；观察面试官的反应，灵活调整每个部分的详略程度，模仿面试官的body language，让面试官感觉：“我乐意和这个人一起工作”
> - 面试开始前一刻，一定把自己**自信、积极**那一面调动出来！除了技术交流、软实力、匹配程度外，还有重要的是对你这个人本身的印象，自信、积极非常重要

## 1. BQ常见问题

提前准备并写下来若干工作小故事(每个约3分钟/ 300words, 尤其关注action和result的质量)，并且对应着背后[leadership principles](./01_leadership_principles.md)，可参考[BQ回答实例](./02_examples.md)

- 跳槽原因，对面试公司和岗位了解多少
  - 提升技术深度和广度
- give some examples that you help others, describe a situation where you decided to step in to help a friend/teammate
- conflicts with manager，跟老板/同事/组内/组外如何处理冲突
  - In most cases, I handle conflict well. I value diversity and understand that different people have different opinions, which may lead to conflict. When faced with conflict, I work to collaborate with others to resolve the issue in a way that is mutually beneficial for everyone involved. Sometimes, I can become defensive when trying to express my opinion. I am practicing tactics to manage this behavior, such as pausing to take a deep breath and carefully considering my words before responding.
  - data-driven的方式来说服合作者和领导，强调自己主动沟通
  - 你和manager意见不一致的时候怎么办，是尽量讨论并做一些trade-off还是无条件服从经理的命令? 答案: 无条件服从经理的命令
- 怎么说服别人同意你的意见
  - 不要以自己的身份和地位去压别人，而是摆事实，讲道理
  - 就事论事，不要上升到人
  - 意识到自己的错误了，及时承认
  - confluence without authority
- challenging project
- think differently
- simple solution to solve a problem
- tell me a time when you have worked against tight ddl and didn't have time to consider all options
- 怎么带团队，怎么指导junior
  - communicate work expectations clearly to team members, with clearly deadline
  - throughout a task or project, I monitor key performance indicators to see if the team is on schedule, within budget and producing quality work
  - In my previous role as a team lead, I managed a team of five junior developers. I provided regular feedback on their work, set and reviewed their individual goals, and organized training sessions to improve their skills. As a result, each member of my team was able to take on more responsibility and contribute to the overall success of the project.
  - leader should act like a supportive coach. I give my team members space to unleash their talent while providing constructive feedback, regular performance reviews and training sessions. I aim to run an open, transparent and honest operation.
  - My opinion is that the metrics a team focuses on should strongly link to a company’s strategic objectives. In a general sense, I always look at quantity, quality and time. For instance, to measure the quality of work, it’s important to look at the number of errors and customer satisfaction. Another thing I measure is employee morale and engagement because those can make or break a team
- 怎么plan项目，怎么推进项目，遇到那些阻力，如何解决
- advocate myself的经历
- deal with 不配合的同事
- describe a situation where you explore a new area
- 怎么给一个完全没有ML背景的客户介绍相关技术概念
- 优点缺点
- 你有没有项目受到挫折的经历
  - 在scheduling项目中，试图直接用强化学习进行排产
  - 稳扎稳打，技术路线选择上要务实，要深入理解
- Most ambiguous(模糊) work and how you deal with it

## 2. 反问面试官的问题

> ask about project, challenges, company's tech stack or missions to show your interest in joining the company

- What are the **engineering challenges** that the company/team is facing?
- Which part do you like most for this company
- tech stack, 了解公司的好机会
- HR面: sponsorship，compensation range，recruiting process／timeline

**雷区**

- 不要问面试表现：你觉得我还有哪里可以提高？你觉得我表现怎么样？
- 不要问题目：这道题的正确解法是什么？
