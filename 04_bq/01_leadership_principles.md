# [Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles)

围绕亚麻14条principle准备，最好明显说出来符合哪条principle。每一条原则用心揣摩理解，准备约两个故事，通过约15-20个故事覆盖，把故事的技术细节准备得**极详细**

## Customer Obsession 顾客至上
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.


## Ownership 主人翁精神
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job."


## Invent and Simplify 创新简化
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.


## Are Right, A Lot 决策正确
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong business judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.


## Learn and Be Curious 好奇求知
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.


## Hire and Develop the Best 选贤育能
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.


## Insist on the Highest Standards 最高标准
Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.


## Think Big 远见卓识
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.


## Bias for Action 崇尚行动
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.


## Frugality 勤俭节约
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.


## Earn Trust 赢得信任
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.


## Dive Deep 刨根问底
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.


## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit 敢于谏言，服从大局
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.


## Deliver Results 达成业绩
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
