# 362. Design Hit Counter

[https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hit-counter/](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hit-counter/)

## solution

clarification

- the data comes in unordered? several hits carry the same timestamp?

```python
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-hit-counter/

class HitCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        # 过去5分钟敲击
        self.timestamps = [0] * 300
        self.hits = [0] * 300

    def hit(self, timestamp: int) -> None:
        i = timestamp % 300
        if self.timestamps[i] == timestamp:
            self.hits[i] += 1
        else:
            self.timestamps[i] = timestamp
            self.hits[i] = 1

    def getHits(self, timestamp: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        for t, h in zip(self.timestamps, self.hits):
            if timestamp - t < 300:  # 5分钟以内
                res += h
        return res
```

## follow up

- Most Efficient Way: TreeMap
- [concurrency](https://aonecode.com/getArticle/211)
  - Major issue on scaling the hit counter is concurrency calls. When two hits write to the array at the same time, possibly one of them gets lost. A **write lock** protects the system from losing hits, but it slows down the process. This works pretty well when you don’t have a large volume of requests or performance is not a concern
  - In order to quickly handle a large number of requests, move the hit counter to a distributed system and have several machines counting together. Hash the userID to assign them to different hosts. Add load balancer on top to make sure requests gets allocated evenly.
  - On each individual machine, take the approach in solution to gather the counts.
  - Upon reading, sum up the count across all machines. For a read-heavy application, put a cache on top so that multiple read requests that take place in the same second does not incur unnecessary cross-node communications.
