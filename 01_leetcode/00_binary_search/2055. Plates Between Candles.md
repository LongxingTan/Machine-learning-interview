# 2055. Plates Between Candles

[https://leetcode.com/problems/plates-between-candles/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/plates-between-candles/description/)

## solution

```python
class Solution:
    def platesBetweenCandles(self, s: str, queries: list[list[int]]) -> list[int]:
        ans = []
        indices = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c == '|']  # indices of '|'

        for left, right in queries:
            l = bisect.bisect_left(indices, left)
            r = bisect.bisect_right(indices, right) - 1
            if l < r:
                lengthBetweenCandles = indices[r] - indices[l] + 1
                numCandles = r - l + 1
                # 这里用indices计算中间的数量非常巧妙
                ans.append(lengthBetweenCandles - numCandles)
            else:
                ans.append(0)
        return ans
```
