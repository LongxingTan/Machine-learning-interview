[https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/description/)

## solution

- 注意[此类型的BS](./410.%20Split%20Array%20Largest%20Sum.md)有时不容易想到. 边界的确定也能考验理解程度

```python
# 使用bisect: https://algo.monster/liteproblems/1011

class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        l = max(weights)
        r = sum(weights)

        while l < r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if self.can_ship(weights, mid, days):
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return l

    def can_ship(self, weights, mid, days):
        need_days = 1
        capacity = 0
        for weight in weights:
            if capacity + weight > mid:
                need_days += 1
                capacity = 0
            capacity += weight
        return need_days <= days
```

时间复杂度：O(n \* log(S)) <br>
空间复杂度：O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        l = max(weights)
        r = sum(weights)

        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if self.get_days(weights, mid) > days:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid
        return l

    def get_days(self, weights, mid):
        i = 0
        subarray_sum = 0
        for weight in weights:
            if subarray_sum + weight > mid:
                i += 1
                subarray_sum = weight
            else:
                subarray_sum += weight
        return i + 1
```
